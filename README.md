# Attack-Defend-Text-Game
In this Python project, I created an interactive menu-driven program that allows users to:
 • Compare the value of two pizzas by calculating their cost per square inch
 • Perform basic math operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
 • See a fun joke or emoji
 • Navigate easily with a main menu and continue/quit options

The program handles user input carefully, checks for invalid entries (like letters instead of numbers), and gives clear error messages. I used while-loops, functions, if/elif/else conditions, and exception handling (try/except) to make the program user-friendly and reliable.
