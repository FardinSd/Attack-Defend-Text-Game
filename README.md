# Attack-Defend-Text-Game
In this Python project, I created an interactive menu-driven program that allows users to:  • Compare the value of two pizzas by calculating their cost per square inch  • Perform basic math operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)  • See a fun joke or emoji  • Navigate easily with a main menu and continue/quit options.
